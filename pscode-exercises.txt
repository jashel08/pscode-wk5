// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
pseudocode:

ask for a number
attempt to divide number by 0
if remainder is 0, even
if remainder is 1, odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

pseudocode:
ask for user to enter first number to average, store value in variable firstNum
ask for user to enter second number to average, store value in variable secondNum
ask for user to enter third number to average, store value in variable thirdNum
ask for user to enter fourth number to average, store value in variable fourthNum
ask for user to enter fifth number to average, store value in variable fifthNum
calculate average of 5 entered numbers ((firstNum + secondNum + thirdNum + fourthNum + fifthNum)/5), then store value in variable averageNum
calculate max of 5 entered numbers, store value in variable maxNum
calculate min of 5 entered numbers, store value in variable minNum
print "The average of the numbers you entered is " + averageNum /n
      "The maximum number is " + maxNum /n
	  "The minimum number is " + minNum
